## The Future: Xamarin.Essentials

I have been working on Plugins for Xamarin for a long time now. Through the years I have always wanted to create a single, optimized, and official package from the Xamarin team at Microsoft that could easily be consumed by any application. The time is now with [Xamarin.Essentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/essentials/
), which offers over 30 cross-platform native APIs in a single optimized package. I worked on this new library with an amazing team of developers and I highly highly highly recommend you check it out:

I will continue to work and maintain my Plugins, but I do recommend you checkout Xamarin.Essentials to see if it is a great fit your app as it has been for all of mine!

#### Settings Plugin or Xamarin.Forms App.Properties
I get this question a lot, so here it is from a recent issue opened up. This plugin saves specific properties directly to each platforms native settings APIs (NSUserDefaults, SharedPreferences, etc). This ensures the fastest, most secure, and reliable creation and editing settings per application. Additionally, it works with **any Xamarin application**, not just Xamarin.Forms.

App.Current.Properties actually serializes and deserializes items to disk as you can see in the [implementation](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/blob/e6d5186c8acbf37b877c7ca3c77a378352a3743d/Xamarin.Forms.Platform.iOS/Deserializer.cs).

To me that isn't as reliable as saving direct to the native platforms settings.
