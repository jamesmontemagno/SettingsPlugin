## Integrating with System Settings

One of my favorite parts of this library is that settings are store natively, which means you can easily integrate your settings into the native system settings. Here are some quick docs to get you going:

* Apple: [Implementing an iOS Settings Bundle](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/UserDefaults/Preferences/Preferences.html)
* Xamarin -> [watchOS Settings](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/watch/working-with/settings/)
* Xamarin -> [iOS Applicaton Preferences Sample](https://developer.xamarin.com/samples/monotouch/AppPrefs/)
* Android: [Getting Started with Settings Screens](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/settings.html)
